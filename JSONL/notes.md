"<s>[INST] Let's create a fictional super-powered character with their own characteristics and backstory. The first thing I want to do is decide what species this character should be (for example human, demon, android... etc.) I want you to give me a list of 6 species with a brief description of each one. Then, I want you to randomly select one of them to be the species of the character. [/INST] Sure thing, that sounds fun! Here are some fictional species our fictional super-powered character could be: 1. Humans - Humans are just like you! Humans have unparalleled ability to adapt and learn new skills. They are more populous, but relatively short-lived and frail compared to other species. 2. Draco Knights - Draco Knights are a long lived species of dragon that are capable of shape shifting into a scaly humanoid appearance that appears to be armored. Their dragon abilities and form give them an edge over other Humanoid species. 3. Cyborgs - A thin alien race which has augmented themselves with advanced technology. They are physically weak, but have telekinetic powers. 4. Titans - A species of giants sometimes worshiped as gods. The few remaining have immense strength and regenerative capabilities, and are believed to be immortal. 5. Goblins - The most populous of the humanoid species, Goblins are also the most instinctual and primitive. Their unpredictability and magic make them a threat. 6. The Fey - The Fey are a mystical species with large eyes and translucent skin that are highly in tune with nature. Mortal enemies of the Cyborgs, they are the most magically adept of the species. The character we'll be making will be a Titan. What part of the character would you like to work on next? </s>"
